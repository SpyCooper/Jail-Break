# Jail-Break

Jail break was an idea of trying to implement NPC AI into a chat based game to break out of jail.
I was using the inworld AI extension through unity but I wanted to work on other projects instead.

All the assets needed to make the game should be in here, the trouble is implementing and setting up the AI to work correctly.
